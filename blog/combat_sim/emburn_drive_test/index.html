            <h1 class="nhrl-title">Emburn Drive Simulation</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="nhrl-paragraph">Emburn is a beetleweight multi-bot flamethrower being developed by Claire from Team WPI. Since it’s a multi-bot, Emburn is made up of two separate 2lb bots instead of a single 3lb one.
        </p>
        <p class="nhrl-paragraph">Recently, a conversation sparked in the Team WPI Discord about whether Emburn should switch from two-wheel to four-wheel drive. The current two-wheel setup places the wheels far to the rear, which makes the bot struggle with traction, especially since it has such a long frame. Adding two more wheels could solve that problem, but it also adds weight that could be used in other parts of the bot.
        </p>
        <p class="nhrl-paragraph">In most combat robots, decisions regarding traction and drive performance are based mostly on vibes and aren’t confirmed until the bot is built and tested. That’s exactly the kind of guesswork I’m trying to eliminate using the digital twin I developed. It uses Nvidia's IsaacSim to simulate how real-world physics apply to combat robots.

        <h3 class="nhrl-subheading">To The Sim Emburn Goes</h3>
        <p class="nhrl-paragraph">I got sent the bot as a STEP file, which I could import directly into IsaacSim. However, it makes setting up functional joints (like the ones that make the wheels spin) a nightmare because I dont know the location of the joint. To fix that, I needed to convert the model into a 
            <a href="https://formant.io/resources/glossary/urdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">URDF format</a>.</p>
        <p class="nhrl-paragraph">Normally, I would import the STEP file into SolidWorks, then convert it to a URDF (if you are curious, here's the <a href="https://github.com/ros/solidworks_urdf_exporter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">Github link</a> you can use to do it). However, my SolidWorks license had expired, and I have to wait a few weeks until school starts to renew it. So I had to find a new way; luckily, IsaacSim has an import from Onshape feature.</p>
        <ul class="nhrl-list" style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li><strong>Technical side rant incoming</strong> 
                <p class="nhrl-paragraph">This feature sucks and is a pain to use. It works okay for simple assemblies, but if your design has a lot of parts, like Emburn, it will have issues importing. I ran into all sorts of issues getting IsaacSim to even load the full assembly. And once it did, the constraints were wrong, and parts were floating or misaligned. You can’t rely on fixed joints; you have to use Onshape’s Group feature to make parts fix properly. Also, the resulting prim paths in IsaacSim are messy compared to what SolidWorks gives you. If you have access to SolidWorks, just use that.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="nhrl-paragraph">Eventually, I got this bad boy imported and configured. I updated a Python controller script I had written to let me drive the bot using my keyboard, and created a GUI to adjust the drive speed. With that everything was ready to go for testing.</p>

        <h3 class="nhrl-subheading">Testing Time</h3>
        <div class="nhrl-paragraph">
                <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Initial Drive Test</p>

            </ul>
          </div>
        <p class="nhrl-paragraph">As theorized, Emburn had terrible traction; the wheels were placed too far back. On top of that, because the bot is so long and the wheels are relatively small in diameter, the front of the chassis dragged on the ground and constantly high-centered the bot whenever it tried to turn.</p>
        <img src="/blog\combat_sim\emburn_drive_test\img\Screenshot 2025-08-05 012938.png" alt="Telbot" class="nhrl-hero-image">
        <p class="nhrl-paragraph">To fix the high-centering issue and improve traction, I increased the wheel diameter to 75 mm and moved the wheels 20 mm closer to the center of the bot, then ran another drive test.</p>
        <div class="nhrl-paragraph">
                <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Drive Test With Modified Wheels</p>
                <video controls class="nhrl-hero-image" preload="metadata">

              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>    
        <p class="nhrl-paragraph">This significantly improved traction and prevented the bot from getting high-centered. However, because Emburn is still so long, its turning radius isn’t great, and the front of the chassis continues to drag along the ground.</p>
        <h3 class="nhrl-subheading">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="nhrl-paragraph">While increasing the wheel size and adjusting their position helped improve traction, switching to four wheel drive will likely be the better solution for Emburn given its long frame. It would not only improve traction even further but also give the bots more pushing power and make them a lot zippier.</p>
        <p class="nhrl-paragraph">I had a lot of fun running these tests; it gave me a reason to use the sim for more than just having Chippy whack things. I love Emburn’s design and can’t wait to see it compete at NHRL and melt things!</p>
